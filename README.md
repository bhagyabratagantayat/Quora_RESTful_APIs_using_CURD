This project demonstrates a RESTful API implementation for a Quora-like platform using Node.js and Express.js, covering all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing posts and users. It includes GET routes to fetch all posts or a single post by ID, POST routes to create new posts, PUT routes to update existing posts, and DELETE routes to remove posts. The project integrates the EJS templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages, serves static files (CSS, JS, images) using Express middleware, and includes proper error handling for invalid routes or missing data. It is designed for beginners to learn RESTful API design, Express.js, and fundamental backend development concepts.
